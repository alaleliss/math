<h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>

<h4>Linear Equations</h4>

<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

<p><span class="forma">ax + b = 0</span></p>  

<p>where <span class="letter">a</span> and <span class="letter">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="letter">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="letter">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="letter">x</span> there.</p>

<h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>

<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

<p><span class="forma">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></p>

<p>where <span class="letter">a</span>, <span class="letter">b</span>, <span class="letter">c</span> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="letter">a</span> can't be 0.</p>

<h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>

<p><span class="letter">&#960</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="letter">r</span>) squared:</p>

<p><span class="forma">A = &#960 &#215 r<sup>2</sup></span></p>  

<p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="letter">D</span>):</p>
 
<p><span class="forma">A = (&#960 / 4) &#215 D<sup>2</sup></span></p>

<p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="letter">C</span>):</p>
 
<p><span class="forma">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215 &#960</span></p>    

<h4>Intersection</h4>

<p>The intersection of two sets <span class="letter">A</span> and <span class="letter">B</span>, denoted by A &#8745 B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

<p><span class="forma">A &#8745 B = { x : x &#8712 A and x &#8712 B }</span></p>  

<p>That is, <span class="letter">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745 B if and only if <span class="letter">x</span> is both an element of <span class="letter">A</span> and an element of <span class="letter">B</span></p>.
